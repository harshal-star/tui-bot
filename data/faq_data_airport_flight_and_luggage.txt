1) What is Advance Passenger Information?
You need to provide Advance Passenger Information (API) before you go on holiday if you're travelling with TUI. It's also called APIS, Secure Flight or e-Borders. In a nutshell, this is information from your passport that's required by the government of the country you're travelling to.

TUI also needs this information for Aviation Security purposes.

 
Flying with another airline? If your flight is with another airline then you'll need to provide your API details at check-in - you won't be able to do this before you travel.

2) How do I provide my API details?
TUI flights
Visit our secure API website to enter your details. You'll need to log in using your TUI booking reference, the surname of the lead passenger and your departure date. You'll find all of these on your booking confirmation or invoice.

If online check-in's open for your flight, you can also enter your API information during the check-in process. If you've opted for a seat upgrade, online check-in opens 14 days before you fly. If not, you can check in from seven days before.

If you prefer the human touch, pop in to one of our TUI stores with your booking reference and all of the passports from your party. That way, we can enter all of the API details for you.
 
Flights with other airlines
For flights with another airline see our FAQs on flying with other airlines for more information about providing your API for your flight.

3) I've changed my booking, do I need to resubmit my API details?
If you've made changes to your booking since providing your API details, you'll need to log in again and resubmit your API information.
 

4) What Information do I need to provide for API?
To meet API requirements, you'll need to give us the following details for everyone travelling on your booking:

For all destinations
Full name, as shown on your passport or travel document

If you're travelling with TUI, you need to give us your API information any time from when you book, up until six hours before you're due to go.

Visit our Flight Extras website to supply your API information.
 
Booking late?
If you're booking less than four days before you travel, you'll need to provide your API at the check-in desk. Please make sure you allow more time for any extra checks.

Flights with other airlines
When you need to provide your API details varies depending on which airline you're travelling with.  If the airline still offers check-in desks at the airport, you'll be able to supply API information when you arrive at the airport.

6) Why do I need to provide API?
API is required by the border control and security authorities of various different countries. They use the details to do routine checks on the identity of passengers before they arrive in the country. It's a condition of your booking that you must provide your API information.

7) What happens to my API information?
Once you've given us your API information, it's stored securely on our system until it needs to be sent to the government authorities. The information is then transmitted through a secure network up to 72 hours before your flight is due to go, or sometimes after it's departed. After the information has been sent, it will be stored to meet API requirements and then destroyed.

Keeping your information secure
We comply with UK and EU data protection laws, so you can rest assured that your details are secure. Your API information will only be sent to authorised government agencies for border control and security purposes.

8) Which airlines do I need to provide API details for?
You'll need to provide API details for all airlines that you travel with. You can submit your API details online with us if you're travelling with TUI.

If you're travelling with any other airline, you'll usually be able to do this online - please follow the instructions on your e-ticket/confirmation email.  If the airline still offers check-in desks at the airport, you'll be able to supply API information when you arrive at the airport. 

9) My birthday is on a leap year, so how do I go about entering my API details?
If your birthday falls on a leap year, you can enter your API details by first selecting the year you were born. Once you've done this, you'll see 29th February appear as an option.

10) How do I know if you've received my API information?
When you enter your API details on our Flight Extras site you won't receive any confirmation.
 
However, you can check if your details have been saved by logging in to the website again - you should see the details you've entered saved in the fields.
 
If you can't see your API details, you'll need to add them again for all passengers and click save when you've finished.

1) Why did I get a Confirmation of Check-in document instead of a boarding pass when I checked in online?
If you're flying with TUI or any of the airlines listed below just to the USA, Mexico, Jamaica, Cuba, Costa Rica or Thailand you'll get a Confirmation of Check-in document which you'll need to print at home, instead of the usual boarding pass. This is because of the different regulations for travelling to these countries or travelling with another airline.

- ASL Airlines France (flight prefix FPO)
- ASL Airlines Ireland (flight prefix ABR)
- Evelop Airlines (flight prefix EVE)

However, you'll need to go to one of the Airline bag drop desks when you get to the airport to swap your Confirmation of Check-in document for boarding passes. You'll need the boarding pass when you go through security.
